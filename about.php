			Torie is a Computer Science major from Palo Alto, CA. Apart from a lifetime of free Chinese food, 
			her dream gift would be a collection of nice-writing pens, placed in the center of a basket filled 
			with sea salt & caramel chocolates. Some other things she enjoys are running, baking, and art.

			Brianna is a sophomore electrical engineering and computer science major from South Pasadena, CA. 
			When she's not running around taking photos for the YDN or staying up into the early hours of the
			morning putting together tomorrow's paper, she enjoys baking chocolate desserts, traveling to warm places,
			and dreaming of ways to keep a pet bunny in her room.
